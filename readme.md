# ClickDelivery : User Management System 
---------------------- 

##INTRODUCTION 
Here is my  Solution to a User Management implementation Test I did in PHP.  I will talk about my solution , the problems  I encounter and what I learned. 

First of all, I have Used another MVC Framework before to make a web app application, this framework is called GLITE , but it is a purely academic framework to implement a Library System (PONER CODIGO AQUI de Biblioteca). 

For this test, I wanted to learn some new Framework , so due the great popularity of Laravel I choose it. The first thing I did was watch video tutorials about larvel and its oficial documentation. 

Once I figured out the way laravel's MVC works, I started Coding.
